            <p>Maybe you hit $100K last month. Maybe you're pushing $500K. But every time you try to scale beyond that ceiling, something breaks.</p>

            <p>You increase budgets... but you're just buying more expensive customers.</p>
            
            <p>You've tried hiring agencies. They promise the moon, take your money, and six months later you're in the same place—or worse.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Here's what's really happening:</span></p>
            
            <p>Most brands (and the agencies they hire) are trying to <span class="italic">"boost"</span> before they <span class="italic">"build."</span></p>
            
            <p>They're pouring gasoline on a broken engine and wondering why it won't go faster.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. Peak season is coming. Your competitors are scaling. And every day you stay stuck is costing you <span class="bold">thousands</span> in missed revenue.</p>
            
            <p>But what if I told you there's a completely different way?</p>
            
            <p>A method that fixes the foundation FIRST... then scales it predictably?</p>

            <h2>The $2.7 Million Breakthrough That Changed Everything</h2>
            
            <p>Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now.</p>
            
            <p>I had a client—a supplements brand doing about $500K per month. Good product, decent margins, but completely stuck.</p>
            
            <p>We'd tried everything. Split testing ads. New creative angles. Different audiences. Hiring "Facebook experts."</p>
            
            <p>Nothing worked. We'd scale up, ROAS would crash, we'd scale back down.</p>
            
            <p>Then Black Friday was coming. The owner was panicking. He said, <span class="italic">"If we don't crack this, I'm shutting down the ad spend and going back to organic only."</span></p>
            
            <p>That's when I realized we were doing everything backwards.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Instead of trying to scale what was broken, I decided to rebuild it from scratch.</span></p>
            
            <p>First, I consolidated his fragmented ad account. Instead of 47 different campaigns competing against each other, we created ONE campaign per country with Campaign Budget Optimization.</p>
            
            <p>Then I audited every winning creative from the past 2 years—even the ones his previous agency said were "dead." Turns out, 30% of them still had juice.</p>
            
            <p>But here's the real breakthrough...</p>
            
            <p>Instead of discounting the products to increase conversions, we created a <span class="bold">high-perceived-value gift</span> that only activated when customers hit our ideal average order value.</p>
            
            <p>No more race-to-the-bottom pricing. No more margin destruction.</p>
            
            <p>The result?</p>
            
            <p><span class="caps bold">$2.7 million in the first 14 days of Black Friday.</span></p>
            
            <p>We only stopped because they sold out of inventory.</p>
            
            <p>That's when the "Build & Boost" method was born.</p>

                <li><span class="bold">Account Consolidation:</span> Combine scattered campaigns into streamlined, machine-learning-optimized structures that actually scale</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Winner Resurrection:</span> Audit and reactivate proven creative assets your current agency probably threw away</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Offer Engineering:</span> Design high-AOV offers using free gifts instead of discounts—maintain margins while boosting conversions</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Unit Economics Optimization:</span> Lock in profitable numbers before spending a dime on scaling</li>

            <p><span class="bold">Because it leverages Facebook's machine learning instead of fighting it.</span></p>
            
            <p>When you consolidate campaigns and feed the algorithm clean, consistent data, it gets smarter faster. When you scale gradually instead of jumping budgets, you stay in the "learning sweet spot."</p>

            <h2>Everything You're Wondering About Build & Boost</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How is this different from hiring another Facebook ads agency?</div>
                <p>Most agencies just manage your current setup—they don't rebuild it. Build & Boost completely reconstructs your foundation before scaling. Plus, our DIY option teaches you the system so you're never dependent on agencies again.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if my business is too small/too big for this to work?</div>
                <p>The method works for any e-commerce brand doing $30K+ per month. We've scaled brands from $50K to $2M monthly using the same core principles. The tactics adjust to your size, but the framework remains the same.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does it take to see results?</div>
                <p>The Build phase typically takes 2-3 weeks. The Boost phase can show results within days once implemented. Our fastest case study went from $500K to $1M in 31 days, but every brand is different based on their starting foundation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if I've already tried consolidating campaigns before?</div>
                <p>Most people consolidate incorrectly—they just merge campaigns without fixing the underlying issues. Our consolidation method includes creative audits, offer optimization, and proper machine learning setup. It's not just about fewer campaigns; it's about smarter campaigns.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do you guarantee specific revenue numbers?</div>
                <p>We guarantee improvement in your scaling ability and ROAS efficiency. Specific revenue depends on your product, market, and implementation. But if you don't see measurable improvement in 60 days, we'll refund your investment completely.</p>
